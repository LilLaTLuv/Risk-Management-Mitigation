## 3. Risk Analysis Report: Workers Werks Credit Union (WWCU) IT Security Risk Management Plan (October 6, 2024)

This report evaluates the existing IT Security Risk Management Plan (v. 1.0, Oct 2015) at Workers Werks Credit Union (WWCU). The analysis reveals significant shortcomings in the plan's scope, risk identification, impact assessment, and mitigation strategies, highlighting WWCU's vulnerability to cyberattacks and data breaches.

**Key Areas of Weakness Identified:**

* **Scope:** Insufficient focus beyond software and hardware implementation.
* **Risk:** Lack of a systematic approach to risk identification and assessment, neglecting industry-specific threats and the impact of organizational growth.
* **Impact:** Insufficient assessment of the potential financial impact of cyberattacks.
* **Mitigation:** Absence of detailed mitigation strategies for identified risks.
* **Legal Compliance and Ethical Considerations:** Limited coverage of emerging data privacy regulations and ethical data use.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

* Develop a more comprehensive risk management framework aligned with industry best practices (e.g., NIST CSF).
* Implement a robust risk identification methodology.
* Develop a methodology to estimate the financial impact of security incidents.
* Create a data backup and disaster recovery plan.
* Implement a risk-based approach to prioritize mitigation strategies.
* Address current and emerging legal and regulatory requirements.
* Highlight the consequences of non-compliance.
* Incorporate ethical principles of data privacy.
* Review and update the plan regularly.
